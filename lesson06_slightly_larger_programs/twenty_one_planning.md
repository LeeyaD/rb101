FIX
1. Make #player_turn answers more intentional, ONLY 'h' or 's' is valid
2. Define #compare_hands
3. Define #declare_winner
4. What methods are nearly identical that can be combined & made more flexible?
5. Correct language (e.g. "Your hand:"/"Dealer's hand:")
6. Reviewing timing of gameplay, where would it be better for player to press enter to continue?
7. Move more prompt over to yml file
8. What can be made into a constant?
9. Run Rubocop
